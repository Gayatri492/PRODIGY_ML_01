# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms using a Linear Regression model. The project includes training the model on a dataset and providing predictions for custom inputs.

---

## Features
- Predicts house prices using **square footage**, **bedrooms**, and **bathrooms** as input.
- Compares actual sale prices from the dataset with predicted prices (if available).
- Visualizes model performance with plots of actual vs. predicted prices.
